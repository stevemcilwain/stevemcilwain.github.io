My name is **Steve Mcilwain** and this is my collection of hacking tips and tricks. I am a cyber-security enthusiast with almost 25 years in the technology industry. I have learned in this field that no one is ever an expert on anything, technology changes and advances too fast. We're all noobs... so I enjoy sharing what I have learned and am studying on a continual basis. I use creativity blended with experience to solve complex problems and build new tools. Feel free to reach out to me if you would like to collaborate on projects, need advice on your career plans or simply would like to connect.
