## The Problem
I wanted to run the Kali Linux XFCE version in my virtual machines as a lighter-weight desktop to reduce resources, but the default experience doesn't work well with HiDPI displays.  There is a HiDPI theme and you can change font DPI size but it still lacks.  I also found the switch from my Pop!_OS host running Gnome to XFCE kind of jarring and distracting.

## The Solution
I found an existing XFCE desktop theme for Pop, which I modified heavily to fix bugs and scale assets for HiDPI.  I also configured XFCE settings to mimic Pop!_OS behaviors and user experience. It took many hours of reverse engineering the theme, but I am pleased with the outcome and setup a Github repo for others who want to try it out.
