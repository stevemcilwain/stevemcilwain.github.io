title: Dealing with WOW64
---
## The Problem

<p>Exploit code in general is a problem, it can be rough around the edges, specific to certain environments and libraries, have syntax errors and bugs.  Some Windows-based exploits require an understanding and navigation of 32-bit application compatibility on 64-bit systems, which Windows calls "Windows on Windows" or WOW64.  This also applies to Powershell, which has both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of powershell.exe.</p>
